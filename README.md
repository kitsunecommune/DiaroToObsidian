# Small Program to convert some of my old data from the Diaro mobile app to Obsidian

I am kinda sad that the format that Diaro backs up data isn't proper XML or anything else that I can really identify.
This meant I didn't feel totally comfortable trying to use any prebuilt deserializers
If I do everything right eventually you should be able to just run the exe with a file name and have everything create in a new folder



This is all for data version 2 so hopefully in the future the files don't look *completely* different so others can use this
as it stands currently though the basic format looks like the example that I have in Examples/BasicStructures.xml
the only example that I've tried this with is aroun 9k lines so if you have millions of lines it's possible this won't work without some edits
